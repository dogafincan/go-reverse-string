# go-reverse-string

_A string reversal package written for educational purposes._

In order to become a better software developer, I believe it's important to explore other languages and their ecosystems. This project is one of those explorations. I've used it to learn about how Go handles strings, how to write tests in Go, and how to publish a library in Go.
